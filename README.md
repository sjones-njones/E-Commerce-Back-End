## Description

This app allows an E-Commerce company to view and manage products, tags, and categories fir their site. This is the first time I have used Sequelizer. I struggled the most with many-to-many association.  

## Installation 

This app requires Mysql2, Express, NPM, Dotenv, and Sequelize to be installed to run properly. The user must run the NPM i command in the console to install the dependencies.
